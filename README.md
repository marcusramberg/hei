# hei - hey in nim

This is a WIP port of [hey](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles) to Nim.

The main idea is a unified simple way to deal with the nix command line tools.

`hei` can be used as a flake in your config, or you could run it directly here to test it out.

Run it without arguments to see the help message.
