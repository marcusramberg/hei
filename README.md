# hei - hey in go

A simple tool to manage your nix environment.

This is a port of hey to Nim, with some extra features.

The main idea is a unified simple way to deal with the nix command line tools.

hei can be used as a flake in your config, or you could run it directly here to test it out.

Run it without arguments to see the help message.
